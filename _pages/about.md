I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Currently, my main ongoing research areas are 1) lithospheric dynamics of the North American Plate, 2) subduction initiation during supercontinent cycles, and 3) global adjoint convection model. I am also working with collaborators from CIDER 2022 on planetary science problems, such as hydrogen distribution history within terrestial planets and triggers for Marsquakes.

My essential research tool is analytical and numerical modeling. With data-assimilated modling techniques, my PhD works focus on understanding lithospheric and mantle dynamics, in particular for the conterminous United States.

Right panel shows the complex mantle structure beneath the North American Plate from a high-resolution, fully coupled lithosphere-mantle model. Starting with the regional North Ameica model, I investigate the driving forces for intraplate earthquakes and volcanism. To further understand the cause of intraplate seismicity and volcanism on a global scale, we are developing a new generation of global model with fully coupled lithosphere-mantle system. The adjoint convection model is our first step towards a well constrained mantle structure. In addition, the global adjoint convection model will give useful insights to the link between intraplate volcanism and slow seismic anomalies in the upper mantle.*
