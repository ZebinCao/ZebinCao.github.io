I am a PhD candidate at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Currently, my main ongoing research areas are 1) lithospheric dynamics of the North American Plate, 2) subduction initiation during supercontinent cycles, and 3) global adjoint convection model. I am also working with collaborators from CIDER 2022 on planetary science problems, such as hydrogen distribution history within terrestial planets and triggers for Marsquakes.

My essential research tool is analytical and numerical modeling. With data-oriented modling techniques, my PhD works focu on understanding lithospheric and mantle dynamics, in particular for the conterminous United States.
