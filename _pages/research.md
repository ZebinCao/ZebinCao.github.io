Lithospheric dynamics
======

The origins of intraplate deformation and volcanism have been debated for decades. For example, the tectonically active western U.S. (WUS) has widespread crustal motion, clustered seismicity, and clustered volcanism. To further understand the lithospheric dynamics in the WUS, particularly the lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions caused by the complex mantle and lithosphere structures, we develop a fully coupled lithosphere-mantel model. This model well explains the observed crustal deformation, asthenospheric azimuthal anisotropy, crustal stress state, and strain localization in the WUS. In addition, the model provides new insights into the origin of the clustered intraplate volcanism in this region (Cao and Liu, *in prep*).

***(a)** GPS measured crustal motion (UNAVCO) and earthquakes during the past 40 years (from USGS, with magnitudes larger than 3) overlying the LAB in the WUS. The size of dots present the magnitudes of earthquakes. **(b)** Slab surface, intraplate volcanoes, and hot asthenospheric materials overlying the LAB in the WUS. Colored contours represent the depth of slab surface. Red triangles indicate the locations of volcanoes during the past 2 million years (NAVDAT). The orange isosurace with red outlines indicate hot asthenospheric material (with > + 30ËšC than the ambient mantle) at 150 km.* </span>
