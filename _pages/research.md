Lithospheric dynamics
======

The origins of intraplate deformation and volcanism have been debated for decades. For example, the tectonically active western U.S. (WUS) has widespread crustal motion, clustered seismicity, and clustered volcanism. To further understand the lithospheric dynamics in the WUS, particularly the lithosphere-asthenosphere interactions caused by the complex mantle and lithosphere structures, we develop a fully coupled lithosphere-mantel model. This model well explains the observed crustal deformation, asthenospheric azimuthal anisotropy, crustal stress state, and strain localization in the WUS. In addition, the model provides new insights into the origin of the clustered intraplate volcanism in this region (Cao and Liu, *in prep*).

Colored contours represent the depth of slab surface. Red triangles indicate the locations of volcanoes during the past 2 million years (NAVDAT).

Plume dynamics
======

Recent volcanoes in Hawaii could be divided into two distinct chains based on lead isotopes (Abouchami et al., 2005, Nature). The origin of this double volcanic chains is debated. We develop a high-resolution geodynamic model to explore the potential plume-plume interaction beneath Hawaii. This model could explain origin of the two distinct volcanic chains, fluctuations in magma flux, and the recent southward bend observed in the volcanic chains (Zhang et al., submitted).

Subduction initiation
======

Subduction initiation (SI) along passive margins is a critical stage in the supercontinent cycle, during which the total length of convergent margins increased sharply during supercontinent breakup. However, the mechanism of SI at passive margins remains debated for decades. Recent studies suggest that the continental lithospheric mantle (CLM) may consist of a buoyant upper layer and a dense lower layer, a density configuration that could trigger delamination of the dense lower CLM during separation of a supercontinent. We are developing high-resolution 2D geodynamic models with viscoelastoplatic rheology to investigate SI triggered by delamination and the associated geological processes.

Global adjoint convection model
======

The dynamics of slow seismic anomaly in the upper mantle is a key component to understanding the mantle convection system. However, due to its ill-constrained dynamic properties and unknown initial location, the temporal evolution of slow seismic anomaly is hard to reproduce in forward modeling approaches. The adjoint method provides a chance to model the evolution in an iterative way. We are developing a global adjoint convection model to investigate the dynamic properties and temporal evolution of slow seismic anomaly in the upper mantle.
